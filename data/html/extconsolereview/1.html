A year and a half after its launch, the Nintendo Switch has almost entirely lived up to the initial promise it made. While I may not have brought it out at any rooftop parties, I have played major games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Skyrim on the train, had spontaneous Mario Kart 8 sessions with friends, and have still been able to sit down on my couch and play all of those games and more on a big screen. And though daily use has forced a few design flaws into the light, the Switch has easily solidified itself as one of my favorite consoles.

The Switch's biggest selling point truly does stand as its greatest strength: being able to effortlessly bring console-quality games anywhere you go. While it seemed like a lofty goal when the Switch was first announced, it's one Nintendo has soundly delivered on in almost every way that counts. I love how easy it is to go from playing docked to undocked and back again, and I don't really feel like I've paid for that ability with the quality of the games I'm playing.

To be absolutely clear, the Switch is undeniably an underpowered system when compared to the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, much less the PS4 Pro and Xbox One X, and those sacrifices in power are especially noticeable when you look at graphically toned-down ports like Doom or Rocket League. But the fact that it's capable of running those games at all while being portable and barely bigger than a plus-sized phone (not including the attached Joy-Con, at least) is fantastic.

A year and a half after release, the Nintendo Switch has delivered on its initial promise of allowing us to play high-quality games both at home and on the go - it just hasn't gone much further than that. Being able to play its absurdly impressive (and still rapidly growing) library of both first and third-party games seamlessly on a TV and a handheld device is just as great as I hoped it would be, even if some design flaws have cropped up since we first got our hands on it. The Switch doesn't have all the entertainment and social features people have come to expect from a home console, but that doesn't stop it from being a disruptively good gaming machine with some of the best exclusives of this generation.

If you go into Breath of the Wild expecting another adventure through the fantasy world of Hyrule like the many times before then you'll definitely be in for a surprise. Breath of the Wild took a risk with a different, experimental and even difficult approach to the Zelda franchise and landed running as a result leading to Breath of the Wild becoming one of the most brilliant Zelda games within the franchise.

Breath of the Wild opens with the hero Link waking from a hundred years of slumber, emerging into a version of Hyrule distinctive from all those that came before, it introduces the player to an open world, full of living creatures and hidden populations, traders and threats. The comparison for this game could be closely linked to the extensive draw of the open world that Skyrim introduces to the player within its first 10 hours of gameplay however, Zelda takes leaps and bounds to carve its own path within this genre.

Director Hidemaro Fujibayashi, producer Eiji Aonuma, and their team at Nintendo, have redefined what a Zelda game is, from the ground up. Breath of the Wild is a masterpiece.

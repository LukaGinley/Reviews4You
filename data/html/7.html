Pokemon Sword and Shield begins like the many Pokemon adventures before it, after creating an ambitious young trainer you're given the exposition of Pokemon and their integral role within society. Moments like these reminded me of my first Pokemon adventure bringing nostalgia and homage to past titles, picking your starter Pokemon- Sobble, Scorbunny & Grookey has always stood out as the moments that define your Pokemon adventure which Sword and Shield don't fail to establish. However, what can be viewed as a fall coming within this new instalment is the absence of past generation Pokemon to be found within Galar leaving me wanting more.

Pokemon Sword and Shield is an excellent entry in Game Freak's iconic franchise, pushing the series forward in some exciting ways while never forgetting the roots that made it so loved in the first place. While it underwhelms in its visuals and under-baked use of new ideas, the act of exploring Galar and catching creatures remains as delightfully compelling as it's ever been - and that's what really matters in the end.

Anyone who has played an Animal Crossing game in the series' 19-year existence will immediately know what to expect. And will find much that is familiar, to boot - especially in theme and graphical style. However, the gentle life sim has this time swallowed a survival game with a side order of Minecraft, resulting in something larger, more involving and, well, better.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the first new entry in the mainline Animal Crossing series in almost 8 years, in addition to being the first playable entry on Nintendo Switch. It offers players a familiar yet fresh feel combining the old enjoyable parts of the series with some much-needed new additions to add far greater depth to the series than ever seen before.

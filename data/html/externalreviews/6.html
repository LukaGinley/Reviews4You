There are so many different types of Animal Crossing players, and yet Animal Crossing: New Horizons manages to improve upon the virtual lives of each player type that I can think of. For The Collector, there's a near-bottomless bounty of bugs, fish, and furniture to gather; for The Designer, there are new tools and few limits to what you can craft and customize. But it's the The Artists, The Decorators, and The Dreamers who should be most excited: There's an entire island to jazz up, expanding the customizable area far beyond the walls of your house, which is all that previous Animal Crossing games allowed them to tinker with. Throw a swimming pool on the beach; add a giant kaiju statue to your garden; even literally move mountains. You can customize so much in New Horizons that it has me just as excited to see what people create as recent, lauded craft-'em-ups like Super Mario Maker 2 or Dreams.

In order to deliver a blank slate for you to customize the crap out of, Nintendo made some questionable calls that lead to a very slow start to Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Yes, Animal Crossing always starts out slow. But New Horizons is even slower: At the outset, two brave villagers and a very industrious raccoon family are the island's only residents. Cut off from any mainland, it's just you, trees, water, rocks, and slow accumulation of buildings and animal villagers over the course of several (real time) days. It's a different vibe than moving to a new town already full of bustling shops and animals going about their lives, and while building a town from scratch offers a lot of customization, it takes too long to get to the good stuff. And by "good stuff" I mean the basics: The museum, shopping, and even access to parts of the island which require tools like the pole and ladder to reach, all days away from when you first load up New Horizons on your Switch.

Like past games, Animal Crossing: New Horizons uses your Nintendo system's real clock, which means many game goals are locked behind a "sleep wall." Like the paywall found in some mobile games, which requires you to pay real money for resources to progress, in New Horizons you have to wait until the next actual day to see the bridge you built, or the store you upgraded, or the animal you invited to town come to fruition. There's just not enough to do for these first few days while the sleepy island is waking up. You can't scale cliffs or cross rivers until you satisfy requirements that span several real time days. To make it worse, resources deplete and reset daily, so outside of fishing and bug hunting you can't even effectively farm for bells while you wait. Unless, of course, you cheat it by changing that system clock.

The Legend of Zelda, Pokemon, and Super Mario each found new life on the Nintendo Switch, and following those games in kind is Animal Crossing: New Horizons: An expanded, polished, next-generation reboot of a classic Nintendo game. Perhaps most importantly, like Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is full of surprises. I cannot wait to see what's to come: Seeing cool custom islands from the community, special events, season changes. It took too long to get to the most exciting part of my island renovation (until I cheated), but now that all of New Horizons is spread before me, I have plenty to do, big plans for my island, and so much to look forward to.

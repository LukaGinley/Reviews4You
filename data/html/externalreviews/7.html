Very few things in life can make me as happy as a great Pokemon RPG, and Sword and Shield repeatedly left me in a state of pure, child-like joy. The elated surprise of not knowing what's coming is something this series does extremely well if you can manage to play it relatively unspoiled (fear not, this review won't deprive you of that), and I'm glad that sense of wonder is still alive and kicking in Sword and Shield. With every new game in this 23-year-old series, changes big and small are always made, but I've never been willing to declare the latest entry the new gold standard for Pokemon because they've consistently been a balance of better and worse. But the first mainline game on the Switch has changed that: though there is still no "perfect Pokemon game," the 40-plus hours I've spent with Sword and Shield have left me comfortable with calling them the best Pokemon games I have ever played - and I've played 'em all.

Experiencing the avalanche of improvements made me realize just how complacent I'd become with Pokemon mechanics that were, in hindsight, less than ideal. While this series has always been great about introducing new players with thorough tutorials, it seems crazy that experienced players have never been able to skip them until now. Just tell the NPC you know what's up and they'll get out of the way and let you get down to the business of catching and training - you can even catch Pokemon without being told how, and doing so automatically skips the tutorial. Likewise, travel across the map has been made fast and convenient, and even connecting with other people is as simple as pressing the Y button. And perhaps most overdue of all, Sword and Shield have killed the sacred cow of the traditional random encounters that have all too often made exploring feel like a slog. All throughout, Sword and Shield feels like it respects your time.

Sword and Shield manage to fix all of these problems while leaving Pokemon's signature charm not just intact, but enhanced by the Switch's huge graphical leap over the 3DS. I never want to go back.

Pokemon Sword and Pokemon Shield are closer to my dream Pokemon RPGs than anything that's come before. I'd still like better cutscenes, companion Pokemon, the complete Pokedex, and a more visually interesting Wild Area, but nitpicks are just not very effective when everything else was such a complete joy to play. The way they respect my time is wonderful, and the removal of monotony from random encounters and other odds and ends distills it down to only the pure and charming fun of capturing, training, and battling wonderful creatures. And hey, if I'm missing any tedious repetition, I can always get back into breeding.

Let’s get one thing straight, right off the bat: Super Mario 3D All-Stars is a collection of ports containing Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Mario Galaxy for the Switch but they are not remasters. The only changes are that each game features dynamic resolution for handheld and docked modes and art for all three games has been upscaled, but not redone or enhanced in any way. Joy-Con rumble effects have been added, and Super Mario Galaxy has some Switch-specific control options. Nintendo has stated that each game has been optimized “for smooth gameplay experience” – more on that in a bit – but overall, these look and feel very similar to how they did on their respective original consoles. It should also be noted that the means by which Nintendo has chosen to port these games to the Switch is by emulating the old consoles, which explains a lot about the lack of upgrades. But for nearly all intents and purposes, the effect is the same.

So talking about the merit of the games themselves versus the overall quality of the collection gets tricky. As such, I haven’t set out to re-review these games because they haven’t changed significantly enough to warrant a new opinion, but I do want to give you an idea of what it’s like to play these old games on new hardware.

To break it down simply, this collection consists of one historical relic, one noteworthy experiment, and one bonafide masterpiece, all delivered in a convenient $60 package. The overall lack of bells and whistles make Super Mario 3D All Stars a bit of a disappointment, but taken as individual works, the games speak for themselves. While I would have loved to have seen a collection more worthy of Mario’s long and winding career, Super Mario 3D All-Stars does just enough to satisfy a longtime fan like myself, but misses the mark by not providing any of the updates and extras that would have really made this collection of classics sing.

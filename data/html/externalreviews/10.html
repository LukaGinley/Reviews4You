I literally applauded as the end credits rolled on Super Mario Odyssey. I'd spent the last 15 hours with a giant grin on my face, and somehow the climax put the perfect surprising and delightful exclamation point on the plumber's latest adventure. This is another brilliant redefinition of the very platforming genre he helped popularize 30 years ago.
And best of all, even with the story complete, Odyssey has so much more fun to offer.

Odyssey looks like a straight successor to the Mario 64 and Sunshine line of sandbox 3D Marios, but it is much more than that. Naturally, it evokes, honors, and is sometimes directly inspired by the games that came before it in its characters, music, and mechanics. But it also has new things to say as well, like fusing classic-style 2D gameplay with the 3D world and using a completely new possession mechanic to add constant variety to Mario's abilities and exploits.

That possession power, embodied by Mario's new sidekick/headwear Cappy, is Odyssey's big new idea. In keeping with Nintendo's decades-long tradition of charmingly nonsensical storylines, he's a hat with a soul, and he's teamed up with Mario in order to rescue his sister Tiara who.. wait for it... has been kidnapped by Bowser along with Princess Peach. (I said it was charming, not original.) Cappy's power allows you to possess many other characters by throwing Mario's hat at them, which bizarrely slurps Mario's physical body inside of the enemy and gives you full control over their powers. Cappy's also used as a jumping pad and a weapon, sparing Mario's tuchus from an untold number of butt-stomps this time around (though you can still do that, if you wish).

Mario's games have been around for almost as long as game consoles have been a thing, but thankfully, he's always evolving. We rarely get the same Mario twice. Super Mario Odyssey delivers on that ongoing promise of originality and innovation: It distills the venerable series' joyful, irreverent world and characters and best-in-class platforming action, and introduces a steady stream of new and unexpected mechanics. It's all spun together into a generational masterpiece.

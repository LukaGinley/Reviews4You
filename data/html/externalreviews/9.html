I'm looking forward to the new Ghostbusters movie coming in 2020, but I'll be surprised if it's as much fun as Luigi's Mansion 3. The anxiety-riddled brother straps the vacuum pack back on for the first time since 2013's Dark Moon for 3DS and headlines one of the funniest and most charming Nintendo games on the Switch yet.

Setting aside the nitpicking fact that Luigi and his friends are checking in at a hotel this time rather than an actual mansion, Luigi's Mansion 3 had me smiling and laughing at its adorable sense of humor right off the bat. From Mario and Luigi's goofy half-English, half-gibberish conversations to communicating with ghost-sucking vacuum backpack inventor Professor E. Gadd through a Virtual Boy (complete with a red-tinted interface and a joke about how "it'll sell millions"), among other examples, Luigi's latest adventure is downright funny.

Mario, it turns out, isn't the only plumber in Nintendo's employ who can carry his own great game. Luigi's Mansion 3 is so much fun, so charming, and so smartly designed that, moving forward, I really hope we get more than three of these games every 20 years. It's absolutely the best Ghostbusters game ever made - it just happens to star Mario's scaredy-cat brother rather than Peter Venkman and Ray Stantz.

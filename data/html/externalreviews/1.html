After 28 years of making marvelous Mario platform games, you'd think Nintendo would run out of ideas. But Super Mario 3D World defies such logic and creatively sets itself apart - in good ways - from its outstanding recent predecessors, Super Mario 3D Land and Super Mario Galaxy 2. The characters and levels all showcase an unbridled sense of joy; the soundtrack crisscrosses between trendy jazz and orchestral arrangements of familiar Mario tunes; and even the surprisingly adorable cat suit managed to melt my stone-cold heart. But, most importantly, Super Mario 3D World nails something that the New Super Mario Bros games could not: it gracefully switches back and forth between a fun solo game and great competitive co-op play.

Of course Mario games have seen their share of vibrant hues and stylized art direction, but Super Mario 3D World outdoes the simplistic visuals of New Super Mario Bros. U by substantial leaps and bounds. There's a surprising amount of texture detail stitched into these worlds, along with subtle lighting and effects that accentuate each onscreen action beautifully. And then there are the little things: Mario and crew leave tiny puffs of smoke with each step and, after you've run for long enough, the trail explodes into a smoke trail. A random pattern of stars popped out each time I pounced on an enemy. These tiny whimsical details add up, and Super Mario 3D World's overall visual design captures a youthful energy that flows into the expertly made levels themselves.

Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury packs a tonne of engaging gameplay, but neither component comes together as elegantly as it might have done. This is a solid option if you're craving more Super Mario for your Switch, but it's not the moustachioed must-play I was hoping for.

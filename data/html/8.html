Hade is a devilishly delightful roguelike adventure through the netherworld and has arrived on Switch through a port the most heavenly that you will find within Hades. Supergiant Games fourth title has been turning the industries and consumers heads since its exclusive arrival on the Switch as Hades pits you as the angsty son of the god of death and does things a little differently compared to its previous catalogue.

Supergiant's latest action gem Hades is a must-play for Switch fans looking for some fast-paced action, especially considering it's currently a console exclusive. The seemingly endless modifiers keep the roguelike gameplay fresh and exciting each run, coming at no expense to its humorous, hellish story.

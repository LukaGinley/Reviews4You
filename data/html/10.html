It's a question I've been thinking about a lot as I've played through Super Mario Odyssey, which launches on the Nintendo Switch tomorrow. There are the core details, of course: Mario jumps, he collects coins, he stomps bad guys. At some point he'll probably face off against an angry turtle named Bowser. But there's something else at the heart of the series, something that has helped it live on for more than three decades across multiple platforms: an unyielding desire to surprise.

At their best, Super Mario games constantly confront you with new ideas, whether it's a new place to explore or a new ability that changes the way you interact with the world around you. And Odyssey exemplifies this more than any game in the series before. It's simply bursting with wild creativity. One minute you're driving a tank down a rain-slicked city street, the next you're dressed as a clown while trying to guide sheep across the desert. At one point you literally possess a giant slab of meat.

But through all of this strangeness - and Odyssey can get really weird - the game remains a constant delight to play.

It's a testament to the sheer creativity underlying Odyssey that, even after watching the credits roll and playing for more than 24 hours, I still regularly come across things I haven't seen before. (The game opens up significantly after you complete the story.) There are coins and moons to collect and tucked-away nooks to discover. There are many moments in Odyssey where it doesn't necessarily look like a Mario game, but more like the squat plumber has been transported into some other virtual realm. But it always feels like Mario - because it never stops surprising you.

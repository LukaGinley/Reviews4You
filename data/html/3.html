Minecraft is a game that needs no introduction, the block building game has been a pop culture sensation for years now and the game has found its way to nearly every console on the planet. The Switch port was no surprise once it arrived, and it was more than definitely worth the wait.

This review will stand more as a review on how Minecraft runs on the console rather than the game itself as I am sure we are all aware at the success of Minecraft and the craze around it. The gameplay is still the exact same with surviving/building being the key focuses of this game with mobs coming out at night and bosses such as the ender dragon providing fun end-game content for players.

The big thing that separates Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition from its predecessors is that we now finally have a true portable version of the game, the Switch version is widely viewed as the best portable version of Minecraft available but misses some key features found within the PC and console versions. If you haven't played Minecraft, or just want it in handheld form, then this should be an easy buy.

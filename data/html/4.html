	This collection contains some of the greatest games ever made from the heart of Nintendo and bundles them together into a neat collection. Super Mario 3D All-Stars can often feel like a ROM dump; however, it is more than that. Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine and Super Mario Galaxy are enhanced emulated versions of the original game with not much more in the way of extra content and technical improvements.

So, if you missed these classic Super Mario games when they were originally released, then you should pick this collection up. However, if you loved these games as a kid and were expecting Nintendo to pull out all the stops and give them the technical update they deserved, you will feel a tad disappointed.

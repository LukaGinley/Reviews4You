Stepping into the world of Hyrule Warriors Age of Calamity felt like reintroducing myself to Breath of the Wild, that feeling of an extensive gripping world instantly grabs you much like its predecessor did so back in 2017. Age of Calamity allows you to spend more time with the beloved characters and world we were introduced to in Breath of the wild and pay homage to the brilliant story-telling that led the game into a story we would never forget.

Age of Calamity begins in the catastrophic past that led us through Breath of the Wild, it leads the player through the extensive war for Hyrule against calamity Gannon that we were only told about within BOTW. It's remarkable how well Age of Calamity works but it is not Breath of the Wild (granted that was a tall order to reach) however, it takes it own path in forging an identity for itself and sits happily within the world of Breath of the Wild to provide players a cure to their BOTW itch before part 2 arrives.

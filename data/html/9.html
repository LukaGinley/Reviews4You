The Luigi's Mansion series has always been on the backfoot of Nintendo's top tier line-up, not to say the previous instalments weren't excellent games in their own regard however they never quite lived up to the potential that other games at the time set. Luigi's Mansion 3 will be the title to change that as it elevates the series with its new entry from Next Level Games. This is easily the best Luigi's Mansion game ever.

Nintendo makes a lot of cute, clever, and charming games, but few of them have been as funny as Luigi's Mansion 3. Nothing impresses me more about the game than its presentation. The animations are fantastic. In or out of cutscenes, Luigi is one of the most expressive video game characters ever. Much of the fun comes from looking at Luigi react, often with horror, to all of the events going on around him.

This is a huge step up for a franchise that has always been enjoyable but never felt special. Well, Luigi's Mansion 3 is special. It's a spooky adventure full of top-notch puzzles and so much charm that you'll be convinced by the end that maybe Luigi has been the best brother all along.

Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury have been given new life on the vastly more popular Nintendo Switch, saving it from the ill- fated Wii U as it releases sitting between both a rerelease and remake. The new release of Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury is near-identical from its 2013 Wii U version, with a few new adaptions and the addition of a new friendly online multiplayer mode.

Bowser's Fury is a new addition to 3D World and offers the generously sized standalone expansion included within the re-release. The fully open-world expansion included takes the series into uncharted territory, the co-op has been reduced down to two players for you to enjoy the more chaotic nature of the DLC. However, this game does not have the same polish or precision we've come to love from mainline Mario games, but it is still a welcome addition to the roster.

3D is one of the brightest and most family friendly Mario game, it was a welcome addition to the Nintendo Switch family with the new addition of Bowser's Fury especially during this time of Lockdown. It is a great purchase for you and your family.
